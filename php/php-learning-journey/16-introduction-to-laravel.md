# Lesson 16: Introduction to Laravel

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

## Why Laravel?

- **Elegant Syntax:** Laravel has an expressive and elegant syntax that is easy to read and write.
- **Rich Feature Set:** Laravel comes with a rich set of features, including routing, authentication, sessions, caching, and more.
- **Vibrant Ecosystem:** Laravel has a vibrant ecosystem of packages and tools that can help you build amazing applications.
- **Strong Community:** Laravel has a large and active community, so you can easily find help and support.

## Installing Laravel

There are several ways to install Laravel. The easiest way is to use the Laravel installer.

### Via Laravel Installer

First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Once installed, the `laravel new` command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify.

```bash
laravel new my-app
```

### Via Composer Create-Project

Alternatively, you may also install Laravel by issuing the Composer `create-project` command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-app
```

## Directory Structure

A fresh Laravel installation has the following directory structure:

- **`app`:** Contains the core code of your application.
- **`bootstrap`:** Contains the files that bootstrap the framework.
- **`config`:** Contains all of your application's configuration files.
- **`database`:** Contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
- **`public`:** Contains the `index.php` file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application.
- **`resources`:** Contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.
- **`routes`:** Contains all of the route definitions for your application.
- **`storage`:** Contains your compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
- **`tests`:** Contains your automated tests.
- **`vendor`:** Contains your Composer dependencies.

## Running the Development Server

Laravel comes with a built-in development server that you can use to run your application locally.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## The MVC Pattern

Laravel is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

- **Model:** Represents the data of your application. It is responsible for interacting with the database.
- **View:** Represents the user interface of your application. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It is responsible for handling user requests and returning a response.
