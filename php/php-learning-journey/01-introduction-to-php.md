# Lesson 1: Introduction to PHP

Welcome to your PHP learning journey! This first lesson will introduce you to the world of PHP, its history, and what you need to get started.

## What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

## History of PHP

PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. It originally stood for "Personal Home Page," but it now stands for the recursive acronym "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor."

## Why Learn PHP?

- **Widely Used:** PHP is used on millions of websites, including some of the biggest names on the web like Facebook and WordPress.
- **Easy to Learn:** PHP has a relatively simple syntax, making it a great language for beginners.
- **Large Community:** There is a vast community of PHP developers, which means you can easily find help and resources online.
- **Good for Web Development:** PHP is designed for web development, with features that make it easy to create dynamic web pages.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To start writing PHP, you will need a development environment. Here are the components you will need:

1.  **Web Server:** A web server like Apache or Nginx is needed to process PHP code.
2.  **PHP:** You will need to install PHP itself.
3.  **Database:** A database like MySQL or MariaDB is often used with PHP to store data.

The easiest way to get all of these components is to use a pre-packaged solution like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. These packages are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Installation Steps (using XAMPP)

1.  **Download XAMPP:** Go to the [Apache Friends website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the version of XAMPP for your operating system.
2.  **Install XAMPP:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3.  **Start the Web Server and Database:** Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
4.  **Verify Your Installation:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the XAMPP dashboard.

## Your First PHP Script

1.  **Create a new file:** Open a text editor and create a new file named `hello.php`.
2.  **Write the following code:**

    ```php
    <?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
    ?>
    ```

3.  **Save the file:** Save the file in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
4.  **View the file in your browser:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/hello.php`. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Congratulations! You have just written your first PHP script.
